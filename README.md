### Instructions

Render the issues list from a github repo (ie `https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues`)(bonus points if repo can be changed)
List item should show the issue title, author and date created (bonus points for tags, author avatar, etc)
List should have client side filtering (must be client side, do not use the Github API) for open and closed issues (bonus points for tags)
List should have client side sorting for date created (Desc, Asc).
 

### Requirements

Must use React. Feel free to use ui libraries, do not spend too much time with styling. (Too much dependencies might affect the candidates score)
Instructions to run the code (from clone to running dev server)
 

We want to see the candidates ability to write clean and easily readable code as well as explain their thought process. Once they come in they will be asked to add or remove a feature from the app.
